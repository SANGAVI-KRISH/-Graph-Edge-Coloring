# -Graph-Edge-Coloring
Graph Edge Coloring
A Python project that generates different types of graphs and applies edge coloring using a greedy algorithm. It visualizes the graph with colored edges and calculates execution time.

Features
✅ Generate various types of graphs:

Complete Graph

Cycle Graph

Star Graph

Fan Graph

Sibling Graph

Binary Tree Graph

Path Graph

✅ Perform Edge Coloring using a greedy approach.
✅ Visualize the graph with colored edges using networkx and matplotlib.
✅ Measure execution time for coloring the edges.
